# Emergency Situations


Assignments missed due to emergency situations (illness, serious injury, or death in your immediate family) will be considered on an individual basis.  You must submit your request for an extension in writing; verbal communication is not sufficient.  

Please use the following guidelines to prepare your request:

* Your request for an extension or accommodation must include your name, a detailed description of the nature of the emergency, and the assignment that you missed.
* Your request must be signed and handed directly to me no later than one week after the assignment's due date.
* Failure to comply with these guidelines could result in a zero recorded for the assignment.
