Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity (http://www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html) will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. Violation of the Academic Integrity Code requires the instructor to submit an Academic Integrity Violation Report to the Dean’s Office. Any attempt to submit work that is not the student’s own work is a violation of academic integrity. If I find that a writing assignment contains evidence of plagiarism, the level of severity will determine whether the sanction is an F in the course, a 0 score on the assignment, or partial credit on the assignment. A second academic integrity offense in the course will result in an automatic grade of F.

I will usually send out e-mail notices using the University e-mail addresses available through Canvas. Such notices are also posted as Announcements on Canvas. 5.1 University Email Policy Each student is issued a University e-mail address (username@pitt.edu) upon admittance. This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication with students. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications. The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e-mail via other service providers (e.g. Gmail). Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address. To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account, click on ‘Edit Forwarding Addresses’, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your account when you have finished.

Your request must be signed and handed directly to me no later than one week after the assignment’s due date. Failure to comply with these guidelines could result in a zero recorded for the assignment.

On-time completion of all items of the rubric following the norms of scientific writing (formatting, tone, focus, and to some extent grammar and spelling) will result in a score of 87% of the points for the assignment. Additional points can be earned up to the maximum possible by submitting work that displays research, polish, professional quality and/or effort beyond what is outlined in the rubric. Similarly, work that displays significant improvement in effort or writing skills may earn additional points. 7.1 Tips for MEETING the “B” standard on assignments Turn in the assignment on time Double check that you’ve met all the requirements for the assignment; if one is available use the rubric as a check-off list. Re-read your assignment one last time before submitting to check for spelling, grammar, and formatting mistakes. Make sure any and all references, citations, and species names are formatted correctly. 7.2 Tips for EXCEEDINBG the “B” standard on assignments Finish the assignment a day early, then re-read it before submitting it. Have a friend, labmate or family member read it and make revisions based on their feedback Consider your choice of references you’ve used. Have you selected the best thing to cite for a particular statement? Is there something more recent? Should you cite the primary literature instead of a review? Should you cite a review instead of the primary literature? Are there any run-on sentences? Should they be split into two sentences? Are your sentences as direct and clear as possible? Have you unnecessarily used commas, prepositional phrases, or put things into parentheses (Honestly, you probably should never put stuff in parentheses unless it’s for a very specific purpose, like statistics).
