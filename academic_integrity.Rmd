# Academic Integrity

Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated.  Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity (http://www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html) will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor.  

Violation of the Academic Integrity Code requires the instructor to submit an Academic Integrity Violation Report to the Dean’s Office.  

Any attempt to submit work that is not the student’s own work is a violation of academic integrity.  If I find that a writing assignment contains evidence of plagiarism, the level of severity will determine whether the sanction is an F in the course, a 0 score on the assignment, or partial credit on the assignment.  A second academic integrity offense in the course will result in an automatic grade of F.
