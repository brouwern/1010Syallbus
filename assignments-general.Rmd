# Assignments - General Policies

Unless otherwise noted, assignments are due at the *beginning* of class on the specified class day.  

Class starts on time, so assignments turned in after 2 pm will be considered late.  

The final paper will be due during finals week at a time to be determined.  

<!-- Grades will be reduced 10% per 24-hour period following assignment due date -->
